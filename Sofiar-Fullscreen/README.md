# Sofiar-Fullscreen
A Magisk module to replace the default camera cutout overlays with ones that let apps use the entire screen.  
Was originally in a test build but was decided it should be an opt-in situation and not an opt-out one.  
Intended for roms without display cutout emulation.  

# Downloading 
You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/ph4n70m-404/Sofiar-Magisk-Modules/releases/tag/Sofiar-Fullscreen-v1).  
It should work on majority of roms.
