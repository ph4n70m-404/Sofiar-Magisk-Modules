# LineageActions-Replacer
A Magisk module to replace older versions of LineageActions with my newer one on Sofiar roms.  

# Downloading 
You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/ph4n70m-404/Sofiar-Magisk-Modules/releases/tag/LineageActions-Replacer-v1).  
It should work on all the roms that don't have MotoActions.
