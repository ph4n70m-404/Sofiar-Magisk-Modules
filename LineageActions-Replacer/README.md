# LineageActions-Replacer
A Magisk module to replace older versions of LineageActions with my newer one on Sofiar roms. Has a second variant called LineageActions-Replacer-and-Moto-Note that installs Moto Note alongside it and has Moto Note and Stylus settings shortcuts in the MotoActions menu.  

# Downloading
You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/ph4n70m-404/Sofiar-Magisk-Modules/releases/tag/LineageActions-Replacer-v2).  
The normal variant should work on all the roms.  
The LineageActions-Replacer-and-Moto-Note variant will only work properly on roms with stylus support and is useless on non-sofiap devices.
